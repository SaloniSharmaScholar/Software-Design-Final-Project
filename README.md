GitHub Repository Link (5 points)
Provide the link to your GitHub repository for TAs to view the code.
Code Coverage Report (2 points)
Rerun the code coverage report. Code coverage must be above 80%.
Project Demo (3 points)
Present a demo prior to the project due date.

Implementation Tips
PDF Generation:

Most technologies and frameworks have built in libraries to generate a pdf such as ReportLab (Python) or PDFKit (Node.js) to generate PDF reports.
CSV Generation:

Most technologies and frameworks have built in libraries to generate CSV file such as csv (Python) or csv-writer (Node.js) to generate CSV files.
